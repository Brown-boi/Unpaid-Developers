Course Comparison Web Application
Overview
This project is an interactive web application designed to help students in the Department of Computer Science and IT at our university compare various courses offered. It allows students to assess graduate outcomes, skills acquired, and subject content to make more informed decisions about their course choices. The application will also leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to address student-specific queries regarding course details.
